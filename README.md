# FiniteElement

Hello! Welcome to my Finite Element Method Repo.

My name is Rafael and I'm a Mechanical Engineering graduate student at the University of Central Florida.

This is a compilation of homeworks and projects using Python.

The main focus is: Shape functions, 1D and 2D element problems, Gauss quadrature and more!

Please reach out if you have any questions or just to connect!

Thanks

Rafael Avila
